Welcome to the Devhook Firmware Installer readme! Believe it or not, this is still one of the most commonly unread 
documents. Ironic, isn't it?
Well, you've made it this far, so congratulations.


If you don't know how to use this program, here's how (fail-proof):

1) Open the ZIP file this came in.
2) Extract everything in the MS_ROOT folder to the root of you memory stick (ms0:/) [ex. F:/]
3) Put the firmware EBOOT in the root of your memory stick also
4) Run program
5) *Enjoy your Devhook!

(This program runs on firmware 1.50 PSPs and also the Custom Firmwares [SE->OE], but NOT 1.00!)

It really is that simple.

*NOTE: You can only run the firmwares that your current Devhook supports. If you use the Devhook included in 
this release, 2.70 and below will not work, and 3.30 and above will also not work. If you want the lower fw
versions to work, you'll have to get past versions of Devhook, and if you want the upper firmwares to work 
you'll need to wait for a newer version.

*** I WILL RE-RELEASE THIS PACKAGE WITH THE NEW DEVHOOK AND EVERYTHING NEEDED ONCE IT IS RELEASED ***
